# 🌀 SVM Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for anomaly detection.  
Instead of relying on pre-built datasets, I generated my own synthetic dataset using **`sklearn.datasets.make_classification`**, giving me full control over class imbalance and feature distribution.  

The goal: **detect anomalies (rare events)** in a highly imbalanced dataset.

## ⚙️ Features
- Custom dataset creation with `make_classification`
- Two-feature dataset for easy visualization
- Heavy class imbalance (normal vs anomaly)
- SVM with **RBF kernel** for nonlinear decision boundaries
- Class weighting to handle imbalance
- Visualization of data distribution and decision boundary
